<h1>Web Accessibility and Usability</h1>
<p><strong>Browser Comptability</strong></p>
<p>Most of this website contains HTML5 and CSS elements and layouts which is best-suited for the known browsers
like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Apple's Safari. 
My website has been tested using all of these web browsers to make sure it's fully workable. Some of the browsers passed, others didn't not.
In other words, some web browsers was compatible with all the HTML5 elements but not CSS and other times, it was the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Text Size</strong></p>
<p>The text is large enough for people who are visual challenged. But just in case, some browsers have tons of features
where you can zoom the pages in or out on my website using shortcut keys on most computers.
<p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong></p>
<p>All the links on my website open in a single window when clicking on any of the links. There will be no new tabs open so the backspace button
in all web browsers will work. I also changed the color of the hyperlinks for people that are colorblind and they will be able to see the links more clearly.</p>
