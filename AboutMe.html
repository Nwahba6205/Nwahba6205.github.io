<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm originally from Key Largo, FL and I moved to Fort Myers in the Fall 2017 for college.
	I'm currently a Sophoremore at Florida Gulf Coast University pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. 
	I plan in the future using my degree to help create and design apps for mobile phones. I'm also interesting in doing graphic designing.
	In the Fall of 2018, I got accepted into the Honors Colleges at FGCU and it was a dream come true for me because that was my main goal of coming here.
	Becoming an Honors College student has helped me become even more efficent and continues to give me the strive for success needed for all my classes. </p>
	
<p> My campus involvement includes being a member of FGCU's Programming Board Traditions Committee and also Vice President of the FGCU Film Club.
	In my free time, I like to play video games, biking, working out, relaxing at Waterfront, and spending time with my friends. I love watching Try Not to Laugh videos and
	other video games players on YouTube. My favorite series of videos is the ASDFmovies because it's very random and funny at the same time.
	My other goals while being at FGCU pertains to my major such as trying to get a minor in Digtial Media Design, try building websites, and personally try out a new hobby.</p>
